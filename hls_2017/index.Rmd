class: inverse, middle, center

# Overview

---

# Overview

### What is it?

- PsychoPy2 is a free program made in Python 
- It can be used to create experiments in psychology, psychophysics, neuroscience and linguistics.

</br>

--

### Why do you want it?

- It's free!
- It's cross-platform
- It has a GUI (builder mode) or you can write in code

---

# Overview

### What is it good for?

- PsychoPy2 can be used to create psycholinguistic tasks: 
    - 2AFC
    - AX, AXB, ABX
    - Lexical decision (masked prime)
    - Production experiments
    - Pretty much anything you can design

</br>

# A simple experiment

### Two alternative forced-choice grammaticality judgment task

- We are interested in studying age effects in second language acquisition. 

--

- We decide to look at the acquisition of verb morphology in L2 learners of English (based on Johnson & Newport, 1989)

--

- We want to show our participants a series of sentences.

--

- Some sentences will contain incorrect past tense morphology and some sentences will 
be grammatical.

--

- Participants will see the sentences on the screen and decide if they are grammatically correct of incorrect.

--

- Our hypothesis: We expect a negative correlation between age of acquisition and response accuracy.

# **What did we learn?**

1. We can use **stimuli text components** to present text on  
the screen in a <blue>routine</blue>

2. We can give the components useful names

3. We can control *when*, *where*, and for *how long*  
the text appears

4. We can also adjust the font and the colors

5. It is possible to present stimuli other than text  
(i.e., sounds, images, videos, etc.)

# Participant control - Response components

- Participants will now be able to use the left and right arrow keys to make their judgments

- Now let's add two more text components &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to help them decide
  - On the left side we'll put a 'Correct' text component
  - On the right side we'll put an 'Incorrect' text component

# **What did we learn?**

1. We can include **keyboard response components** in our <blue>routine</blue> to record participants' responses

2. We will often use response components in conjunction with stimuli components

3. We control *how long* they last and *what* they record 

4. There are many response possible components (i.e., keyboards, button boxes, microphones, mouse clicks, etc.)

--

### How do we include many trials?

<div align="center">

# Condition files and loops

- The solution is to create a **condition file** with all our trials and *loop* through them in a single <blue>routine</blue>
- 2 options: .csv file (textedit.app, notepad) or .xlsx file (excel)
- Choose your favorite and make a file with the following characteristics:

<div>
  <img width="450" src="../assets/img/psy/15a.png">
  <img width="100" src="../assets/img/fill.png">
  <img width="450" src="../assets/img/psy/15c.png">
</div>

---

<div>

  <img width="100" src="../assets/img/fill.png">
  <img width="450" src="../assets/img/psy/15c.png">
</div>

- Each column represents a variable in our experiment
- Use informative variable labels
- Avoid spaces, unusual characters, periods, etc.
--

- I have included
  - <blue>item</blue>: the experimental item (sentence) to be displayed
  - <blue>grammaticality</blue>: if the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical
  - <blue>verb</blue>: the infinitive of the verb
  - <blue>corrResp</blue>: whether the *correct response* corresponds with the left arrow (correct) or the right arrow (incorrect)

---

<div>
  <img width="450" src="../assets/img/psy/15b.png">
  <img width="100" src="../assets/img/fill.png">
  <img width="450" src="../assets/img/psy/15d.png">
</div>

- Create any sentences you want (or copy these ones)
- Save the file to the **myexp** folder
- Name the file **condition_file.csv** (or condition_file.xlsx)

---

# Condition files and loops

- We are ready to **loop** through our trials in our <blue>routine</blue>

- Click 'Insert Loop' from the *flow* menu

# Condition files and loops

- The loops is ready, but we need to let our **text_sentence component** know about our <blue>condition_file</blue>

- Click on **text_sentence** 

- We are going to tell the text component that we want it to present the items in our condition file from the column called *item*

---
class: middle

<div align="center">
  <img width="400" src="../assets/img/psy/19a.png">
  <img width="100" src="../assets/img/fill.png">
  <img width="400" src="../assets/img/psy/19b.png">
</div>

- The **$** tells python that 'item' is a variable that needs to be updated on each trial
- Do not forgot to change the text constant to "set every repeat"!!!

---

# Condition files and loops

- We can also tell psychopy that we know what the correct answer should be for each trial 

- We created this variable in our **condition_file** in the column <blue>corrResp</blue>

- So we need to update our key_resp_sentence component so that it logs the correct responses

- Click on "key_resp_sentence"

- If our participant gets the answer wrong, pyschopy will store a 0, if the answer is correct it will store a 1

# Almost done...

### But what about age of acquisition???

- Our hypothesis is that AoA is negatively correlated with response accuracy

- We need to include AoA in the experiment so that it will be logged for each participant

- Click on the **experiment settings** icon &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to adjust the "experiment info" field

# Run the experiment!

- After you have made the final changes, save, and run the experiment

- You can now fill out the info prompt with your participants data

<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="../assets/img/psy/22.png">
</div>

---

# What did we learn?

- We can display as many items as we want using routines

- The most efficient way to do this is to create a **condition file** and <blue>loop</blue> through the items

- We can refer to the variables (column names) of our condition file in components using **$** (i.e., $item)

- Whenever we use a loop we must change the variable in question to *set every repeat*

---

# Results

- Look inside your **myexp** folder for a new folder called "data"

- You should see several log files and .csv files

<div align="center">
<img width="700" src="../assets/img/psy/23.png">
</div>

---
background-image: url(../assets/img/psy/24.png)
background-size: contain

- The experiment output is a .csv file that contains all of our variables in the condition file

- The log files are good for troubleshooting, but in general you can ignore them

- **Note**: the output is a tidy data frame i.e., each column is a variable and every row is a trial

- This is the optimal format for our data for visualization and analysis (in R, for example)

---

# Final touches

### Adding instructions

- It is usually necessary to give our participants instructions so they understand the task 

- Let's include a new routine before our loop

- What components do we need?

--

- Add a **text component** to display the instructions and a **key response component** to begin the experiment
